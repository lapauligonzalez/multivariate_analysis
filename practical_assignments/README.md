# Practical assignments for the course "Multivariate Analysis" 

In the first project, we explored a dataset of Portuguese wines using R, performing exploratory analysis, applying data transformations (such as Box-Cox), and testing for multivariate normality using Mahalanobis distances. We then conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and used biplots to visualize the internal structure of the data. 

In the second project, we used Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to visualize similarities between Spotify songs, combining Gower and Euclidean distances for mixed data types, and evaluated the quality of fit using Kruskalâ€™s stress index. Both projects allowed us to apply dimensionality reduction techniques, outlier analysis, and graphical representations in lower-dimensional spaces.
